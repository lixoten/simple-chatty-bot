Description
Now you will teach your bot to count. It's going to become an expert in numbers!

Objective
In this stage, you will program the bot to count from 0 to any positive number users enter.

Example
The greater-than symbol followed by a space (> ) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.

Example 1: a dialogue with the new version of the bot

Hello! My name is Aid.
I was created in 2020.
Please, remind me your name.
> Max
What a great name you have, Max!
Let me guess your age.
Enter remainders of dividing your age by 3, 5 and 7.
> 1
> 2
> 1
Your age is 22; that's a good time to start programming!
Now I will prove to you that I can count to any number you want.
> 5
0!
1!
2!
3!
4!
5!
Completed, have a nice day!
Note: each number starts with a new line, and after a number, the bot should print the exclamation mark.

Use the provided template to simplify your work. You can change the text if you want, but be especially careful when counting numbers.

IDE=====================
package bot

import java.util.Scanner


fun main() {
    val scanner = Scanner(System.`in`)

    println("Hello! My name is Aid.")
    println("I was created in 2020.")
    println("Please, remind me your name.")

    val name = scanner.nextLine()

    println("What a great name you have, " + name + "!")
    println("Let me guess your age.")
    println("Enter remainders of dividing your age by 3, 5 and 7.")

    val rem3 = scanner.nextInt()
    val rem5 = scanner.nextInt()
    val rem7 = scanner.nextInt()
    val age = (rem3 * 70 + rem5 * 21 + rem7 * 15) % 105

    println("Your age is " + age + "; that's a good time to start programming!")
    println("Now I will prove to you that I can count to any number you want.")

    // read a number and count to it here

    println("Completed, have a nice day!")
}
